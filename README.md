# ClashofCarsGit
Clash of Cars is an interactive game with first person vehicle control, point collection to score points and achieve high scores, and avoiding REALLY REALLY bad traffic! This repo contains C# scripts for game logic - none of the visual game assets are featured here. The game will be launched soon.
